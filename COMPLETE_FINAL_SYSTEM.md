## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order):

### **Step 1: Wait for Scraper to Complete** (~5-10 minutes)

Check if still running:
```powershell
Get-Process python
```

Check progress:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import sqlite3; conn = sqlite3.connect('cruises.db'); cursor = conn.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cruise_deals'); print(f'Deals so far: {cursor.fetchone()[0]}'); conn.close()"
```

### **Step 2: Extract Route Map Images** (~30-60 minutes)

Once scraper finishes:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe extract_ozcruising_images.py
```

This will visit each cruise page and extract route map images.

### **Step 3: Test the System**

```powershell
# Stop current app if running
Ctrl+C

# Restart with new data
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py

# Visit in browser
http://localhost:8000
```

**Test:**
- ✅ Browse deals shows thousands of cruises
- ✅ Click "Details" on any cruise
- ✅ See full cruise detail page
- ✅ Click "Book Now" goes to OzCruising
- ✅ Promo codes page shows 19 codes

### **Step 4: Commit Everything**

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Final: Pagination for 1000s of deals, individual detail pages, 19 worldwide promo codes"
```

### **Step 5: Push to GitHub**

```powershell
# Create repo at https://github.com/new

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cheapcruises.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
