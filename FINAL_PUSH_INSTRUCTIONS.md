## ✅ About the Detail Pages:

**Q: Is it scraping itinerary and other info from the detailed page?**

**A: NO (and that's good!)**

**Current Implementation:**
- Detail page shows info **already in database** from main scrape
- **Fast** - instant page load
- **Efficient** - no extra requests

**What Detail Page Shows:**
- Ship name, cruise line
- Destination, duration
- Departure port, departure date
- Cabin type
- Pricing (per night & total)
- Special offers
- Route map image (when downloaded)
- Direct booking button

**All from the database** - no additional scraping needed!

## 💡 If You Want MORE Info on Detail Pages:

**Currently shows:** Basic info from database  

**To add itinerary scraping:**
Would need to:
- Visit each OzCruising detail page
- Extract: Day-by-day itinerary, ports of call, ship amenities
- **Time:** ~5-10 seconds per cruise = 30-60 minutes for all
- **Worth it?** Maybe later - start with current version

**Recommendation:** Deploy current version, add detailed scraping as v2.0
