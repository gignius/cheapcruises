## Implementation Details

### üîí Security Fixes (Priority 0 - Critical)

#### 1. SQL Injection Prevention ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Boolean comparisons using `== True` are not SQL-safe
**Fix:** Changed to `.is_(True)` in 5 locations
**Impact:** Prevents potential SQL injection in WHERE clauses

#### 2. Input Validation ‚úÖ
**Issue:** No validation on POST endpoints
**Fix:** Added Pydantic models for all POST requests
**Impact:** Rejects malformed data before it reaches database

#### 3. Proper Error Handling ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Generic error responses, no custom error pages
**Fix:** Custom 404/500 handlers with branded templates
**Impact:** Better user experience, proper HTTP status codes

### üìä Logging & Observability (Priority 0 - Critical)

#### 4. Structured Logging ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Print statements everywhere, no log levels
**Fix:** Migrated entire codebase to Loguru
**Impact:** Debuggable production issues, log rotation, proper levels

**Configuration:**
- Log file: `logs/app.log`
- Rotation: 500 MB max file size
- Retention: 10 days
- Levels: DEBUG (scraper), INFO (app), WARNING (recoverable), ERROR (critical)

**Files Updated:**
- `app.py` - 15+ print statements ‚Üí logger calls
- `database_async.py` - Database operations logging
- `scheduler.py` - Background job logging
- `scrapers/ozcruising_scraper.py` - Scraper progress logging
