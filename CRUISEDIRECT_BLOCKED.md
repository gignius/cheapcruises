## 🛡️ Why CruiseDirect Blocks Scraping:

### **Enterprise-Grade Protection:**
- **Cloudflare/WAF:** Web Application Firewall
- **Bot Detection:** Blocks all automated tools

   - ScraperAPI
   - Bright Data
   - Oxylabs

2. **Residential Proxies** ($100-300/month)
   - Rotating IPs
   - Real residential addresses

3. **CAPTCHA Solving** ($10-50/month)
   - 2Captcha
   - Anti-Captcha

**Total Cost: $150-800/month just to scrape CruiseDirect**
